I am not sure what to make of it - I was waiting for the whole book for the story to develop, until at some point the book ended. The general ideas that the author want to transmit are transparent enough, I guess - something along the lines of the loneliness and individualism of modern society, with all its negative consequences -, but they just sit there at the bottom and look at you while you turn the pages. Maybe it's just that I need things spelled out clearly to understand them.
