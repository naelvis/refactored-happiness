I think I read The Sense of an Ending by Barnes at some point in my life, but I have now been chatting with ChatGPT for a while asking him about the book and there is nothing about the plot that rings a bell - one more reason to have the Lesenotizen written down. But I think I must have liked it, because everytime I see a book by Julian Barnes I want to buy it. I suspect that a deeper analysis would reveal that I was reading the book while eating very good cake or something like that, but I guess I'll never know.

In any case, this book goes straight into the category of I-did-not-get-it - I don't know what the author is trying to say or why, I cannot even find something to disagree with, it's like chewing lettuce. But this time at least I have notes.
