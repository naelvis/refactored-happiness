It irritates me that nobody took the time to transcribe the android's haikus from the English edition on a blog or something. It would have been interesting to compare them with the German version.

The book is a bit cliche, but also light and enjoyable. It has a bit of a was-w√§re-wenn component, which I mostly enjoy, and I think one could make a good movie out of it. The male protagonist probably needs to be Adam Sandler. For the woman one could go with Zooey Deschanel, I guess. I am not really sure about who to pick for the android - the way it is physically described, one of those actors who play the hunchmen for the mafia bosses should do.
