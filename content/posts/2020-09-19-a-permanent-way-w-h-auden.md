A Permanent Way
-----

Self-drivers may curse their luck,\
Stuck on new-fangled trails,\
But the good old train will jog\
To the dogma of its rails,

And steam so straight ahead\
That I cannot be led astray\
By tempting scenes which occur\
Along any permanent way.

Intriguing dales escape\
Into hills of the shape I like,\
Though, were I actually put\
Where a foot-path leaves the pike

For some steep romantic spot,\
I should ask what chance there is\
Of at least a ten-dollar cheque\
Or a family peck of a kiss:

But, forcibly held to my tracks,\
I can safely relax and dream\
Of a love and a livelihood\
To fit that wood or stream;

And what could be greater fun,\
Once one has chosen and paid,\
Than the inexpensive delight\
Of a choice one might have made?
