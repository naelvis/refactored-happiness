In the *Translator's Note* at the end we can read:

> Much to the discomfort of his critics, and to the disappointment of many of his fans, who pleaded, 'Write us more things like *Solaris*,' Lem was not content to repeat his previous successess; he continued to follow his own difficult drummer. *The Star Diaries* offers only one example of this stubborn and even restless individuality.

I was in fact expecting a thing like Solaris and I can confirm the disappointment. The problem with older, famous sci-fi is always that most of the good ideas became mainstream since the publication. So even ideas that seemed original at the time now taste stale. I would not say this is the only problem of this book.
