I liked this book and I would be curious about reading something from Swedenborg, except I am not sure if it would be a waste of time.

What sticked the most was the myth of Er, which I had recently heard quoted in [Murubutu's Daimon](https://open.spotify.com/track/64XdgtHEsUoYNqg0ZHyGcb?si=0464a72d443a43dd) (ognuno ha i riferimenti che si merita). Since this is what everybody is doing anyway, I will paste below here the conversation I had about with [openAI's chatbot](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

> **N**: I recently read a book which quoted the "myth of Er". It is a story contained in Plato's Symposium. Are you familiar with it?\
>\
> **B**: Yes, I am familiar with the myth of Er, which is a story told by the character Pythagoras in Plato's dialogue "Symposium." In the myth, Er is a soldier who, after being killed in battle, travels to the underworld and witnesses the souls of the dead being sorted into different lots for their next lives. When it is Er's turn to be reborn, he is given the choice of what kind of life he would like to lead. He ultimately chooses a life of wisdom and returns to the living to share his experiences with others. The myth of Er is often interpreted as a metaphor for the importance of living a good life and the role of wisdom in guiding one's choices.\
>\
> **N**: do you know of any other interpretations of this myth?\
>\
> **B**: There are many different interpretations of the myth of Er, and scholars have debated the meaning and significance of the story for centuries. Some interpretations focus on the idea of reincarnation and the idea that the choices we make in life can determine our fate in the next. Others see the myth as a commentary on the importance of wisdom and the role it plays in guiding our actions.\
> Some scholars have also interpreted the myth of Er as a commentary on the nature of reality and the relationship between the physical world and the spiritual world. In this interpretation, the myth suggests that the physical world is only a shadow or imitation of the true, eternal reality that exists beyond our perception.\
> Other interpretations of the myth focus on the idea of the soul's journey and the importance of living a virtuous life. In this view, the myth suggests that the choices we make in life have a profound impact on our ultimate destiny, and that living a good and virtuous life is the key to achieving happiness and fulfillment.\
> Overall, the myth of Er is a complex and multifaceted story that has inspired a wide range of interpretations and debates among scholars.\
>\
> **N**: thank you. do we know anything about Er, apart from the myth?\
>\
> **B**: The character of Er in the myth of Er is a fictional character created by Plato, and there is no historical record of a real person by this name. In the myth, Er is described as a soldier who dies in battle and then travels to the underworld, where he witnesses the souls of the dead being sorted into different lots for their next lives. After being given the choice of what kind of life he would like to lead, he chooses a life of wisdom and returns to the living to share his experiences with others.\
> Plato often used myths and stories as a way to illustrate philosophical ideas and concepts, and the myth of Er is no exception. The character of Er serves as a vehicle for exploring themes of reincarnation, wisdom, and the nature of reality, but he is not intended to represent a real person.\
>\
> **N**: I guess we just do not know, but yes. do you know of any similar myths, maybe from different cultures?\
>\
> **B**: There are many myths and stories from different cultures that explore similar themes as the myth of Er. Here are a few examples:
> - The Tibetan Book of the Dead: This is a Buddhist text that describes the journey of the soul through the process of death and rebirth. It is believed to offer guidance to the deceased on how to navigate the intermediate state between death and rebirth and to achieve a positive rebirth.
> - The Egyptian Book of the Dead: This is a collection of funerary texts that were believed to help the deceased navigate the afterlife and achieve a successful resurrection. It includes spells, prayers, and rituals intended to protect the deceased and guide them through the underworld.
> - The Hindu cycle of reincarnation: Hinduism teaches that the soul is eternal and undergoes a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. The quality of each life is determined by the actions and choices made in previous lives, and the ultimate goal is to escape the cycle of reincarnation and achieve liberation.
> - The Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice: In this myth, the musician Orpheus travels to the underworld in an attempt to bring his wife, Eurydice, back to the land of the living. His journey serves as a metaphor for the struggle to overcome death and the power of love and music to transcend the boundaries of the physical world.\
> Overall, these myths and stories demonstrate the enduring human fascination with the mysteries of death, the afterlife, and the nature of reality, and the ways in which different cultures have sought to understand and make sense of these concepts.\
>\
> **N**: are these books readable by non-experts?\
>\
> **B**: Some of the texts I mentioned, such as the Tibetan Book of the Dead and the Egyptian Book of the Dead, may be challenging for non-experts to fully understand due to their cultural and historical context and their use of specialized terminology. However, many translations and interpretations of these texts are available that may be more accessible to a general audience.\
> The Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, as well as the Hindu concept of reincarnation, are more widely known and may be easier for non-experts to understand. There are also many books and resources available that provide an introduction to these myths and their cultural and historical context, which may be helpful for those seeking to learn more about them.\
>\
> **N**: thanks! are you familiar with the Australian "Dreamtime" system of beliefs?\
>\
> **B**: Yes, I am familiar with the concept of Dreamtime in Australian Aboriginal cultures. Dreamtime, also known as the "Dreaming," refers to the time of the creation of the universe and all living beings, as well as the spiritual relationships and connections that exist between the land, the people, and the spiritual realm. It is a complex and multifaceted belief system that is central to the worldview of many Indigenous Australian cultures.\
> In the Dreamtime, the spirits of the ancestors created the world and all the elements of the natural world, including animals, plants, and the landscape. These spirits continue to be present in the world and are believed to influence the lives of the living. The Dreamtime is often described as a timeless, spiritual realm that coexists alongside the physical world and is accessible through ceremony and ritual.\
> The concept of Dreamtime is deeply tied to the land and the belief that the land is sacred and holds the stories and history of the people. It is also closely tied to the spiritual and cultural practices of Indigenous Australian communities, and is an important aspect of their identity and heritage.\
>\
> **N**: do you know of any connections of this system of beliefs with the themes we talked above? so the themes of the myth of er\
>\
> **B**: There are some similarities between the concept of Dreamtime in Indigenous Australian cultures and the themes explored in the myth of Er. Both involve the idea of the spiritual realm and the relationship between the physical and spiritual worlds. The Dreamtime is often described as a timeless, spiritual realm that coexists alongside the physical world, similar to the way that the underworld in the myth of Er is described as a place where the souls of the dead exist beyond the boundaries of physical life.\
> Both Dreamtime and the myth of Er also involve the idea of reincarnation and the idea that the choices we make in life can shape our ultimate destiny. In Indigenous Australian cultures, the Dreamtime is seen as the source of all life and the source of the spiritual connections that exist between the land, the people, and the natural world. These connections are believed to be eternal and to continue through the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Similarly, in the myth of Er, the character is given the choice of what kind of life he would like to lead after his death, and his ultimate decision to seek a life of wisdom is seen as a key to achieving happiness and fulfillment.\
> Overall, while there are some similarities between the themes explored in the myth of Er and the concept of Dreamtime in Indigenous Australian cultures, it is important to note that these are distinct belief systems that have evolved within different cultural and historical contexts.\
>\
> **N**: could you tell me more about the idea of reincarnation in Dreamtime?\
>\
> **B**: In Indigenous Australian cultures, the concept of reincarnation is closely tied to the belief in the Dreamtime and the spiritual connections that exist between the land, the people, and the natural world. According to this belief, the spirits of the ancestors continue to be present in the world and are believed to influence the lives of the living.\
> In many Indigenous Australian cultures, it is believed that the spirits of the ancestors can be reincarnated in the form of animals, plants, or other natural elements, and that these elements hold the stories and history of the people. For example, it is believed that a person's spirit may be reincarnated in the form of a particular tree or rock, and that this element holds the memories and experiences of that person's past lives.\
> In some Indigenous Australian cultures, it is also believed that the spirits of the deceased can be reincarnated in the form of a new human being, either through the process of birth or through the transfer of a spirit from one person to another through ceremony or ritual. In this belief, the spirit is seen as being reborn into the physical world and continuing its journey through life.\
> Overall, the concept of reincarnation in Indigenous Australian cultures is closely tied to the belief in the Dreamtime and the spiritual connections that exist between the land, the people, and the natural world. It is seen as a way of maintaining these connections and preserving the stories and history of the people through the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.\
>\
> **N**: do you have any books or references about this topic that you can suggest?\
>\
> **B**: There are many books and resources available that provide more information about the concept of Dreamtime in Indigenous Australian cultures and the role of reincarnation within this belief system. Here are a few examples:\
> - "The Dreaming: An Introduction to Aboriginal Spirituality" by John Mulvaney and Patricia Mulvaney: This book provides an introduction to the beliefs and practices of Indigenous Australian cultures, including the concept of Dreamtime and the role of reincarnation. It also explores the relationships between Indigenous Australians and the land and the importance of spirituality in Indigenous culture.\
> - "The World of the Dreaming: An Introduction to the Spirituality of the Australian Aborigines" by Scott Sutton: This book provides an overview of the beliefs and practices of Indigenous Australian cultures, with a focus on the concept of Dreamtime and the role of spirituality in Indigenous life.\
> - "Aboriginal Spirituality: A Guide for the Perplexed" by Fr. Paul Marshall: This book provides a detailed exploration of the beliefs and practices of Indigenous Australian cultures, including the concept of Dreamtime and the role of reincarnation. It also discusses the role of spirituality in Indigenous life and the ways in which Indigenous Australians have maintained their cultural traditions in the face of colonization and other challenges.\
> Overall, these books and resources provide a good starting point for those interested in learning more about the concept of Dreamtime and the role of reincarnation in Indigenous Australian cultures.\

> **N**: thank you. going back to the myth of er, I was wondering if it would be possible to formulate a Jungian interpretation\
>\
> **B**: Yes, it is possible to formulate a Jungian interpretation of the myth of Er. Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, developed the concept of the collective unconscious, which refers to the idea that all humans share a common store of unconscious knowledge and experiences that are inherited from our ancestors. Jung believed that this collective unconscious is expressed through symbols and archetypes that appear in myths, dreams, and other forms of cultural expression.\
> In the case of the myth of Er, Jungian analysis might focus on the archetypes and symbols present in the story, such as the soldier Er, who represents the hero archetype; the underworld, which represents the unconscious and the unknown; and the choice Er makes about his next life, which represents the process of individuation and the journey towards self-discovery.\
> A Jungian interpretation of the myth of Er might also focus on the theme of wisdom and the role it plays in guiding our choices and actions. In Jungian psychology, wisdom is often associated with the process of individuation and the integration of the unconscious and the conscious mind. Er's choice to seek a life of wisdom might be seen as a representation of this process and the importance of integrating the unconscious in order to achieve a sense of wholeness and fulfillment.\
> Overall, a Jungian interpretation of the myth of Er might focus on the archetypes and symbols present in the story and the themes of wisdom and self-discovery, and how these relate to the concept of the collective unconscious and the process of individuation.\
>\
> **N**: thank you. I also saw a similarity with the story of Zarathustra, who starts his journey by descending from a mountain\
>\
> **B**: Yes, it is possible to see similarities between the myth of Er and the story of Zarathustra, the ancient Persian prophet and founder of the religion of Zoroastrianism. Both stories involve a journey of self-discovery and the search for wisdom, and both feature a hero who descends from a high place and returns to the world to share his insights with others.\
In the story of Zarathustra, the hero is said to have received divine revelations while meditating in a mountain cave. He then descends from the mountain and travels through the world, teaching his revelations and spreading his message of monotheism, ethical behavior, and the importance of living a virtuous life.\
Like the myth of Er, the story of Zarathustra is often interpreted as a metaphor for the journey towards wisdom and the importance of living a good and virtuous life. Both stories also involve the idea of a journey from the spiritual realm to the physical world and the role of the hero in sharing his insights and teachings with others.\
Overall, while there are some similarities between the myth of Er and the story of Zarathustra, it is important to note that these are distinct stories that have evolved within different cultural and historical contexts.\
>\
> **N**: apologies, I was talking about Zarathustra as depicted in the book by Nietzsche (Thus spoke Zarathustra). I think similarities are present there.\
>\
> **B**: Yes, it is possible to see similarities between the myth of Er and the character of Zarathustra as depicted in Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical novel "Thus Spoke Zarathustra." In the novel, Zarathustra is a prophet who undergoes a journey of self-discovery and the search for wisdom. He descends from a mountain, where he has spent many years in solitude, and travels through the world, sharing his insights and teachings with others.\
> Like the myth of Er, the character of Zarathustra in Nietzsche's novel is often interpreted as a metaphor for the journey towards wisdom and the importance of living a good and virtuous life. Both stories involve the idea of a journey from the spiritual realm to the physical world and the role of the hero in sharing his insights and teachings with others.\
> Nietzsche's depiction of Zarathustra is also influenced by the figure of the ancient Persian prophet and founder of Zoroastrianism, who is considered a central figure in the history of Western philosophy. However, Nietzsche's Zarathustra is a fictional character and represents a reimagining of the traditional figure of the prophet in the context of Nietzsche's own philosophical ideas.\
> Overall, while there are some similarities between the myth of Er and the character of Zarathustra in Nietzsche's novel, it is important to note that these are distinct stories that have evolved within different cultural and historical contexts.\
>\
> **N**: are you aware of any part of the myth of er being used in imagining the afterlife during medieval times? I am in particular thinking of Dante's Divine Comedy\
>\
> **B**: There are some similarities between the myth of Er and the concept of the afterlife as depicted in Dante's "Divine Comedy," although it is important to note that these are distinct belief systems that have evolved within different cultural and historical contexts.\
> In the "Divine Comedy," Dante presents a detailed and imaginative vision of the afterlife, including descriptions of heaven, hell, and purgatory. Like the myth of Er, the "Divine Comedy" involves the idea of the soul's journey after death and the role of wisdom and virtue in shaping one's ultimate destiny.\
> In the "Divine Comedy," the soul's journey through the afterlife is guided by the character of Virgil, who represents reason and wisdom. Like Er in the myth, Dante's journey through the afterlife is a quest for knowledge and self-discovery, and the choices he makes along the way have a profound impact on his ultimate fate.\
> Overall, while there are some similarities between the myth of Er and the concept of the afterlife as depicted in the "Divine Comedy," it is important to note that these are distinct belief systems that have evolved within different cultural and historical contexts.\
>\
> **N**: thanks. do you know DALL-E?\
>\
> **B**: Yes, I am familiar with DALL-E. DALL-E (pronounced "dolly") is an artificial intelligence system developed by OpenAI that is capable of generating original images and text based on a given prompt. It works by using a neural network to generate images or text based on a set of input vectors that represent the desired content of the image or text.\
> DALL-E was designed to be able to generate a wide range of images and text based on a given prompt, and has been demonstrated to be able to generate everything from realistic photographs to abstract and surrealist images. It has also been used to generate text descriptions of images, allowing it to function as a kind of visual search engine.
Overall, DALL-E is an innovative and powerful artificial intelligence system that has the potential to transform the way we create and access visual and textual content.\
>\
> **N**: exactly! do you have any suggestions for prompts for DALL-E if I want it to represent the myth of Er?\
>\
> **B**: If you want to use DALL-E to generate images or text based on the myth of Er, you could try using prompts that focus on specific themes or elements of the myth. For example, you might try using prompts that focus on:
> - The journey of the soul after death: You could try using prompts that describe the journey of the soul through the underworld, or the process of choosing a new life after death.
> - The themes of wisdom and self-discovery: You could try using prompts that focus on the importance of wisdom and the role it plays in guiding our actions and shaping our ultimate fate.
> - The symbols and archetypes present in the myth: You could try using prompts that describe the archetypes and symbols present in the myth, such as the soldier Er, the underworld, and the choice of a new life.
> - The relationship between the physical and spiritual worlds: You could try using prompts that describe the relationship between the physical and spiritual worlds, and the ways in which the myth of Er explores this relationship.\
> Overall, the specific prompts you use will depend on the specific themes and elements of the myth of Er that you want to focus on, and the specific images or text you want DALL-E to generate.\
>\
> **N**: could you suggest a specific prompt for each of the categories you listed?\
>\
> **B**: Sure! Here are some specific prompts you could try using for each of the categories I listed:
> - The journey of the soul after death: "Generate an image of a soul traveling through the underworld and encountering the various realms of the dead"
> - The themes of wisdom and self-discovery: "Generate an image that represents the process of seeking wisdom and self-discovery"
> - The symbols and archetypes present in the myth: "Generate an image that depicts the soldier Er and the choice he makes about his next life"
> - The relationship between the physical and spiritual worlds: "Generate an image that illustrates the relationship between the physical and spiritual worlds as depicted in the myth of Er"
> Of course, these are just a few examples, and you can feel free to modify or adapt these prompts to better fit your specific needs and goals.\

> **N**: yes there is still one thing. there is a book by Borges I read in Italian, I am now looking for the title of the English version. The Italian title is "Libro del cielo e dell'inferno". It is a summary of short excerpts about heaven, hell and the afterlife in general. Do you know the English title of this book?\
>\
> **B**: The book you are describing is likely "The Book of Heaven and Hell," a collection of short excerpts about heaven, hell, and the afterlife, compiled and translated by the Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges. The English translation of the book was published under the same title as the original Italian version, "The Book of Heaven and Hell."\
>"The Book of Heaven and Hell" is a collection of texts from a wide range of sources, including literature, philosophy, religion, and folklore, that explore the theme of the afterlife. The book includes excerpts from works by a variety of authors, including Plato, Dante, Shakespeare, and many others.\
> I hope this information helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.

The conversation is unedited. I also gave a shot at the prompts the bot suggested - I specified that I wanted oil painting by appending ", oil painting" at the end of each because it meets my taste more. Since this is what everybody was doing last month anyway, I will post the results (from [DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com)) here:

> **N**: one last thing and then it's really all - could you write a sonnet about the myth of er and the dreamtime?\
>\
> **B**: Certainly! Here is a sonnet inspired by the myth of Er and the concept of Dreamtime in Indigenous Australian cultures:\
>\
>The journey of the soul, a timeless quest,\
>From physical realm to spiritual plane,\
>A choice to be made, a life's request,\
>To seek wisdom or to seek in vain.\
>\

>\
>For wisdom guides us on our journey here,\
>To find a path that leads to happiness clear.
