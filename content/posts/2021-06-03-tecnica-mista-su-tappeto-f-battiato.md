At the end of *L'era del cinghiale bianco* Battiato sings in (I assume?) arabic, but this part of the lyrics is not listed anywhere. Then Battiato died, so I realized I couldn't ask him anymore - not that I ever would have, but now it was not my choice anymore; then I saw on genius a link to this book, and I thought, Oh, maybe there's something about it here.

There wasn't!
