Covid-19 and the whole corona pandemic business must have been in the air, surprising timing for this book! I really liked the fast-paced structure in small chapters, and the way every single chapter is more of a conceptual unit than a temporal/spatial one. A bit like a in a programming pipeline, every step specializes in exactly one thing - the portrait of a character or some revelation.\
Also pleasant how you can piece up together the different parts of the mystery as you read on - usually I don't manage to, and just sit back waiting for the author to explain how everything connects, but here it was actually possible to collect hints and go back and forth in the past chapters to make suppositions, which is fun. But I still did not guess everything, so I thought it was a good level of guessable-but-not-obvious.
