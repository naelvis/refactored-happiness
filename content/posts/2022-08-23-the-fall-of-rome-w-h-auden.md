The Fall of Rome
-----
\
(for Cyril Connolly)\

The piers are pummelled by the waves;\
In a lonely field the rain\
Lashes an abandoned train;\
Outlaws fill the mountain caves.

Fantastic grow the evening gowns;\
Agents of the Fisc pursue\
Absconding tax-defaulters through\
The sewers of provincial towns.

Private rites of magic send\
The temple prostitutes to sleep;\
All the literati keep\
An imaginary friend.

Cerebrotonic Cato may\
Extol the Ancient Disciplines,\
But the muscle-bound Marines\
Mutiny for food and pay.

Caesar's double-bed is warm\
As an unimportant clerk\
Writes I DO NOT LIKE MY WORK\
On a pink official form.

Unendowed with wealth or pity,\
Little birds with scarlet legs,\
Sitting on their speckled eggs,\
Eye each flu-infected city.

Altogether elsewhere, vast\
Herds of reindeer move across\
Miles and miles of golden moss,\
Silently and very fast.
