Reading this book felt like eating cold McDonald's fries, in terms e.g. of the general disappointment one feels about the food during the act and about oneself afterwards, or of the fact that one keeps reading although one would actually not wish to (or wish it to anybody else). But I think that it had several good ideas that were then used in other sci-fi books later - did the whole sand planet crazyness begin here? And the spice?

I will do my best to avoid reading the other books in the series.
