A few words about a book that didn't really speak to me. Before reading it, I thought I really liked the title, after reading I still think that title is the best thing about the book - it's not meant to be a slight, it's really good, it drags you right in.\
As I was saying, I didn't really tune in with the books. Maybe the fact that English is not my mothertongue somehow muffled all the lyric descriptions of various settings, the development of the character did not really seem realistic or anyway justified by the events.

When I was halfway through, I thought I should find at least one line I can relate to. Here goes:
> So I go. I travel farther and faster and harder than most, and I read, and I write, and I love cities. To be alone in a crowd, apart and belonging, to have distance between what I see and what I am.

This is more or less exactly why I like cities! I couldn't have put it into words so effectively. I also like that "love" is presented on the same level of "read" and "write".
