I liked the book, I found it quite similar as for the fundamental themes to Herkunft. The fundamental point remains (aus meiner Sicht) that one must always include time when thinking about places. So there is no paradox in being a stranger in the city one grew up in and then moved out from - when one goes back, time has passed, so the city is in fact different, although it might look the same. One can still be puzzled about it, but it makes sense once time is included.

There is more the book and I also understand roughly three quarters of the words, so I can talk mainly about the gist of it - the gist of it is that is similar to Herkunft and that it is well written and I liked it.
