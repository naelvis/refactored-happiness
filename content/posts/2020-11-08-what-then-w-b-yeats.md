What Then?
-----

\
His chosen comrades thought at school\
He must grow a famous man;\
He thought the same and lived by rule,\
All his twenties crammed with toil;\
'What then?' sang Plato's ghost. 'What then?'

Everything he wrote was read,\
After certain years he won\
Sufficient money for his need,\
Friends that have been friends indeed;\
'What then?' sang Plato's ghost. 'What then?'

All his happier dreams came true --\
A small old house, wife, daughter, son,\
Grounds where plum and cabbage grew,\
poets and Wits about him drew;\
'What then.?' sang Plato's ghost. 'What then?'

The work is done,' grown old he thought,\
'According to my boyish plan;\
Let the fools rage, I swerved in naught,\
Something to perfection brought';\
But louder sang that ghost, 'What then?'
