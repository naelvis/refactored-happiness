It's really more of an action book than a detective story - I really wonder where this series would have gone, had it had more time to develop. After finishing this book I was also finally free to go on the Wikipedia page on the Netflix series and confirm the already strong suspicion I had that it really did not have much to do with the books, as far as the plot was concerned.

I don't have many comments about the book - good entertainment, I liked the first one more -, here are my two bookmarks:
> He lay there for a while feeling a terrible sense of worry and guilt about something weighing on his shoulders. He wished he could forget about it, and promptly did. He levered himself out of bed and a few minutes later padded downstairs.

I find it frames the protagonist nicely. Then about how to do science:
> He had watched upward of a hundred people or so simply vanish into thin air in a way that was completely impossible. That in itself did not give him a problem. The impossible did not bother him unduly. If it could not possibly be done, then obviously it had been done impossibly. The question was how?
