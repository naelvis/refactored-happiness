I have been looking forward to the sequel since reading The Sympathizer, not really a book I would have bought by myself but which I ended up really enjoying. Disappointingly, I don't have much to say about the sequel - when I read a book I don't like, I usually try to look at least for a sentence which is worth carrying along, but I did not get there either.\
This is (of course) not to say that there isn't even a sentence in this book which is worth reading or remembering. But the style is completely different from that of the prequel, verging more on some kind of gang fight story I couldn't really get into. The themes of the book - broadly speaking: imperialism/neocolonialism, racism - remain the same and they are treated in an interesting way, but this does not help much if you cannot digest the writing[^1].
