My problem with book about stoicism is that I agree with the content too much, so reading tends to be a rather bland experience. From what I can tell based on what I read, it is a rather minimalist philosophy - control what you can, disregard what you can't, take responsibility and still be chill about the whole enterprise. The rest is decoration or explanation of why these principles make sense, but I think they are more or less self-evident. It is still good to have the concepts refreshed from time to time.

There is one thing I learned from this book - the existence of the Stoic Week. Here is a [link](https://modernstoicism.com/stoic-week/).
