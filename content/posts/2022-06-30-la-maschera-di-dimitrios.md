I found in it in a second-hand bookshop and bought it since you can usually trust Adelphi. It is a good detective story, which is more than one can ask for. The development was not hard to guess, but hard to guess exactly - it ended in one of the two/three ways I would have bet on, but I thought them all equally probable.
