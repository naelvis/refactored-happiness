My name is Nelvis, I run this page. This is meant to be a catalogue of things I would otherwise forget (books, places, code) and somebody might mind useful, senza pretese di completezza o omogeneit√† di linguaggio.

The "r-h" top left stands for "refactored happiness", which is the name github suggested when creating the repo for this website; the home page looked ugly with both words on top, so I picked one. The subtitle varies.
