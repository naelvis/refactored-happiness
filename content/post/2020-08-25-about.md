My name is Nelvis, I run this page. This is meant to be a catalogue of things I would otherwise forget (books, places, code, music) and somebody might find useful, senza pretese di completezza o omogeneit√† di linguaggio. From time to time I upload pictures to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ink.wis/), the music I stumbled upon and collected ist [hier](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Jk7PEmJVdcC9Nx3ifFhKR?si=ETT74dW7TRCxnseJHit-EA) abgelegt, [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6z9iLx7QFRUr107R5oLhgo?si=eFHn4a36TWy3aQOhyCHQyg) the version without Italian songs. 

The "r-h" top left stands for "refactored happiness", which is the name github suggested when creating the repo for this website; the home page looked ugly with both words on top, so I picked one.
